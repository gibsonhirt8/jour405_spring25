title: "HW2 Prince George's County Crime"
---

In this assignment, we will be working with a dataset reporting the number of crimes by month in Prince George's County, Maryland, for every month in 2024. 

### Task 1: Load the Tidyverse

You will need to load the tidyverse library

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Then you'll load the data from the web. The URL for the data is: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/pg_crime_totals_2024.csv. You will create a dataframe called `pg_crime` that contains the data from this URL.

### Task 2: Load the Data and Describe It

```{r}
pg_crime <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/pg_crime_totals_2024.csv")
```
### Task 3: Describe the Data

You should examine that dataframe carefully by clicking on it in the Environment tab in RStudio. Write a couple of sentences describing the categories of incidents. From a reporting standpoint, are any of the categories more important than others? Why or why not? Do any of them make the job of summarizing the data more difficult? Why or why not?

After examining the data, the first thing I noticed was that many of the categories of crime had subcategories that further broke down the data. There are several types assault, robbery, theft and breaking and entering that helped me better understand the dataframe. From a reporting standpoint, I think that the theft subcategories are the most important because it is the most common type of crime and the most likely to affect a person reading the data. The subcategory of "theft from auto" will help people understand that they are most likely to have personal items stolen from their vehicle than from their body or home. I do not think that any of the categories make summarizing the data more difficult because each category is a different crime and is easy to read and understand for the average viewer or reporter.

### Task 4: Calculating Averages

Calculate the total number of incidents per month for each category using `mutate()`, calling the new column `total_incidents`. Then calculate the average number of incidents per month for each category of crime, calling the new column `average_incidents`. Assign the result to a new dataframe called `pg_crime_averages`.

Question: When I run the mutate function to calculate the total number of incidents per month for each category, it won't give me an answer for "robbery residential" because one of the monthly values was n/a. Is there a workaround to this or am I running the function incorrectly?

```{r}
total_incidents <- pg_crime |> mutate(total_incidents = Jan + Feb + Mar + Apr + May + Jun + Jul + Aug + Sep + Oct + Nov + Dec)
pg_crime_averages <- total_incidents |> mutate(average_incidents = total_incidents / 12)
```

### Task 5: Describe the Averages

Examine the new dataframe, `pg_crime_averages`, by clicking on it in the Environment tab in RStudio. Write a couple of sentences describing the average number of incidents per month for each category. Which categories have the highest average number of incidents per month? Which have the lowest? What does this tell you about the pattern of crime in Prince George's County? Are there categories that you have questions about? Why or why not?

After examining the averages for the crime data, I learned that accidents, stolen automobiles, theft from automobiles, accidents with impound and theft have by far the highest average number of incidents per month. These five categories are the only ones with the average amount of incidents over 300 month. In fact, the next closest category (besides theft) in terms of incidents per month is assault, with just about 71 incidents per month. Accidents, the category with the highest rate, have just under 500 reported per month. On the otherside of things, homicide and breaking and entering were the two categories with the lowest average amount of incidents per month. These two categories are the only ones with less than 10 incidents per month, with 5.8 and 7.0 respectively.

The biggest pattern I found from this data was that all of the most common crimes involved a motor vehicle one way or another. This tells me that people should be the most worried and careful about being the victim of a crime when they are in or around their vehicles.

I don't have any questions about these categories besides my same question from above. When I run the mutate function to calculate the total number of incidents per month for each category, it won't give me an answer for "robbery residential" because one of the monthly values was n/a. Is there a workaround to this or am I running the function incorrectly?

### Task 6: Testing a Theory

One theory about crime is that it is more likely to occur in the summer months. Test this theory by creating three new columns using `mutate()` that calculate the percentage change compared to the average for each category of crime for the months of June, July, and August. Call the new columns `june_change`, `july_change`, and `august_change`. Assign the result to a new dataframe called `summer_crime_averages`.

```{r}
summer_crime_averages <- pg_crime_averages |> mutate(june_change = (average_incidents-Jun)/Jun * 100)
summer_crime_averages <- pg_crime_averages |> mutate(july_change = (average_incidents-Jul)/Jul * 100)
summer_crime_averages <- pg_crime_averages |> mutate(august_change = (average_incidents-Aug)/Aug * 100)
```

### Task 7: Describe the Summer Crime Averages

Look at the `summer_crime_averages` dataframe by clicking on it in the Environment tab in RStudio. Write a couple of sentences describing the percentage change in the average number of incidents per month for each category of crime for the months of June, July, and August. Do you see any patterns? What does this tell you about the theory that crime is more likely to occur in the summer months?

In general, I noticed that crime rates actually appeared to decrease in June compared to the monthly average in many categories, before increasing back up in July and August. The most common incident category, accidents, didn't follow this trend. Accidents increased in both June and July, before decreasing in August. When looking at the more violent crime categories, I noticed that those followed the trend of increasing during the summer months. Assaults increased by just over 14% in July and then another 1.3% in August. The "robbery other" category followed suit increasing by almost 53% in July and then another 19.4% in August. This tells me that violent crimes are more likely to occur during the summer months but other types of crimes don't necessarily follow the same trends.

### Task 8: What's the Story?

Write up a lede and nutgraf of a story focused on the crime data in Prince George's County. It could be from any of the dataframes you've created in this assignment. The lede should be a single sentence that summarizes the most important information in the data. The nutgraf should be a paragraph that provides more context and explains why the data is important.

Residents of Prince George's are most likely to be victimized by crimes involving motor vehicles, data shows.

All of most common categories of reported crime in PG County involved motor vehicles, according to the data. Accidents (5776), stolen automobiles (4790), theft from automobiles (4703) and accidents with impound (3849) were the top four categories with the most reported incidents in PG County. When averaged out by month, these four categories of crime are the only ones with more than 300 incidents per month, well ahead the next most common category, thefts, with only 284 incidents per month. It is much more likely that people in PG County will be the victims of a crime involving a motor vehicle crime than a violent crime.

### Task 9: Save Your Work and Put it on GitHub

Save this notebook, then commit it to your local repository. Push the changes to your GitHub repository and submit the URL for this file in ELMS.
